# Campaign Performance Analysis using Excel and Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing marketing campaign data to evaluate campaign performance and predict outcomes using machine learning techniques.

Excel was used for data cleaning, descriptive statistical analysis, and graphical outlier detection, while the machine learning model was implemented using Python in Google Colab.

## Objectives

- Analyze campaign performance using statistical methods
  
- Perform data cleaning and handle outliers
  
- Visualize outliers graphically in Excel
  
- Build a machine learning model to predict campaign outcomes

## Tools & Technologies

- Excel (Data Cleaning, Descriptive Statistics, Outlier Visualization)
  
- Google Colab
  
- Python
  
- Pandas, NumPy
  
- Scikit-learn

- Machine learning ( Random Forest Algorithm)

## Data Analysis in Excel

- Cleaned and prepared the dataset
  
- Performed descriptive statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation)
  
- Identified outliers using graphical methods (box plots)
  
- Improved data quality before applying machine learning models

## Machine Learning Approach

- Data preprocessing and feature selection
  
- Model training using machine learning algorithms
  
- Model evaluation using appropriate performance metrics

## Files Included

- `campaign_data_raw.xlsx` – Original raw dataset
- 
- `campaign_data_cleaned.xlsx` – Cleaned dataset with descriptive statistics and outlier analysis
- 
- `campaign_ml_model.ipynb` – Machine learning implementation using Python (Google Colab)
- 
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow, combining Excel-based statistical analysis and visualization with machine learning to evaluate and predict marketing campaign performance.
